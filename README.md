## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The architecture consists of:

- **Frontend:** React.js-based user interface for dashboards, analytics, and modules.  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js for API communication and logic handling.  
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, progress details, and contest information.  
- **Integration:** APIs and web scraping from Codeforces, LeetCode, CodeChef, and AtCoder.

### Core Flow:
1. User logs in via secure authentication.
2. System fetches coding activity and contest data.
3. Dashboard visualizes stats, progress, and insights.
4. AI modules analyze resumes and conduct mock interviews.
5. Users receive real-time reminders and notifications.
